# Senior Python Engineer task

## Task description
● Create a currency converter API. It is up to you to pick an external service that will provide
you with current exchange rates.
● This will be a “subscription-based” API. Make sure to expose an endpoint for a user to sign up.
As a response, a user will get an API key and a certain amount of credits.
● Your API will have at least 2 more endpoints. The first endpoint will list all supported
currencies. The second endpoint will be the converter. Your converter should be able to convert
any available currency into other available currencies and it also provides historical data when
requested.
● Limit your API to X req/min (decide the value) and make sure to deduct credits for each
successful request.
● Persistence is not required.
● Comment your code.

## Requirements
● Python 3.8+
● FastAPI framework
● Asynchronous programming (where possible)

## Delivery
● Take this as an opportunity to showcase your skills! Any additional functionality is very
welcomed. However, make sure to allocate no more than 4 hours to implement this task.
● Include README.md file with instructions on how to start the application and expose API
documentation (feel free to use auto-generated FastAPI documentation).

Good luck!
